Step 1: Open Wireshark
Launch Wireshark:
Open Wireshark from your desktop or applications menu.
Step 2: Start Capture in Non-Promiscuous Mode
Select Your Network Interface:
In the Wireshark main window, you'll see a list of available network interfaces. Choose the one you're currently using (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi or eth0 for Ethernet).
Disable Promiscuous Mode:
By default, Wireshark captures in promiscuous mode. To ensure it's disabled, go to:
Capture > Options.
In the options window, uncheck Capture packets in promiscuous mode.
Start the Capture:
Click the Start button (or double-click the selected interface) to begin capturing packets.
Step 3: Generate Network Traffic
While Wireshark is capturing, perform some activities that generate network traffic, such as:
Browsing websites.
Streaming videos.
Downloading files.
Step 4: Stop Capture
Stop the Capture:
Click the red square (stop button) in the toolbar to stop capturing packets.
Step 5: Analyze Captured Packets
Review the Packets:

Look through the captured packets in the main window. You will see a list of packets with various details, such as time, source, destination, protocol, and more.
Apply Filters:

To filter specific traffic, you can type filters in the filter bar at the top. For example:
To filter for HTTP traffic:
Copy code
http
For DNS traffic:
Copy code
dns
For TCP traffic:
Copy code
tcp
Step 6: Start Capture in Promiscuous Mode
Reopen Capture Options:

Go to Capture > Options again.
Enable Promiscuous Mode:

Check the Capture packets in promiscuous mode option.
Start the Capture:

Click the Start button again to capture packets in promiscuous mode.
Step 7: Generate Traffic Again
Repeat the same activities you did earlier to generate network traffic.
Step 8: Stop Capture Again
Stop the Capture:
Click the red square to stop the capture.
Step 9: Analyze the Packets Again
Review and Compare:
Compare the packets captured in non-promiscuous mode and those captured in promiscuous mode. Look for differences in the number and types of packets captured.
Step 10: Document Your Findings
Take notes on your observations, including:
The types and amounts of packets captured.
Any differences between the non-promiscuous and promiscuous modes.
